        <p>A <strong>sausage</strong> is a type of meat product usually made from ground meat, often pork, beef, or poultry,
          along with salt, spices and other flavourings. Other ingredients such as grains or breadcrumbs may be included
          as fillers or extenders.<br/></p>

        <p>Typically, a sausage is formed in a casing traditionally made from intestine but sometimes from synthetic materials.
          Sausages that are sold raw are cooked in many ways, including pan-frying, broiling and barbecuing.
          Some sausages are cooked during processing, and the casing may then be removed.<br/></p>

        <p>Sausages are made in a wide range of national and regional varieties, which differ by the types of meats that are
          used, the flavouring or spicing ingredients (garlic, peppers, wine, etc.), and the manner of preparation.<br/></p>

        <h3 id="History">History</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Sausage making is a natural outcome of efficient butchery. Traditionally, sausage makers salted various tissues
          and organs such as scraps, organ meats, blood, and fat to help preserve them. They then stuffed them into tubular
          casings made from the cleaned intestines of the animal, producing the characteristic cylindrical shape. Hence,
          sausages, puddings, and salami are among the oldest of prepared foods, whether cooked and eaten immediately or
          dried to varying degrees.<br/></p>

        <p>The Greek poet Homer mentioned a kind of blood sausage in the Odyssey, Epicharmus wrote a comedy titled The Sausage,
          and Aristophanes' play The Knights is about a sausage vendor who is elected leader. Evidence suggests that sausages
          were already popular both among the ancient Greeks and Romans and most likely with the various tribes occupying the
          larger part of Europe.<br/></p>

        <p>The most famous sausage in ancient Italy was from Lucania (modern Basilicata) and was called lucanica, a name which
          lives on in a variety of modern sausages in the Mediterranean.<br/></p>

        <h3 id="Casing">Casing</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Traditionally, sausage casings were made of the cleaned intestines, or stomachs in the case of haggis and other
          traditional puddings. Today, however, natural casings are often replaced by collagen, cellulose, or even plastic
          casings, especially in the case of industrially manufactured sausages. Some forms of sausage, such as sliced sausage,
          are prepared without a casing. Additionally, luncheon meat and sausage meat are now available without casings in tin
          cans and jars.<br/></p>

        <h3 id="Ingredients">Ingredients</h3>

        <p>A sausage consists of meat cut into pieces or ground, mixed with other ingredients, and filled into a casing.
          Ingredients may include a cheap starch filler such as breadcrumbs or grains, seasoning and flavourings such as spices,
          and sometimes others such as apple and leek.[8] The meat may be from any animal but is often pork, beef or veal, or
          poultry. The lean meat-to-fat ratio depends upon the style and producer.<br/></p>

        <p>Many traditional styles of sausage from Asia and mainland Europe use no bread-based filler and include only meat
          (lean meat and fat) and flavorings. In the United Kingdom and other countries with English cuisine traditions, many
          sausages contain a significant proportion of bread and starch-based fillers, which may comprise 30% of ingredients.
          The filler in many sausages helps them to keep their shape as they are cooked. As the meat contracts in the heat,
          the filler expands and absorbs moisture and fat from the meat.<br/></p>

        <p>When the food processing industry produces sausages for a low price point, almost any part of the animal can end up
          in sausages, varying from cheap, fatty specimens stuffed with meat blasted off the carcasses (mechanically recovered
          meat, MRM) and rusk. On the other hand, the finest quality contain only choice cuts of meat and seasoning.<br/></p>

        <h3 id="Classifications">Classifications</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Sausages classification is subject to regional differences of opinion. Various metrics such as types of ingredients,
          consistency, and preparation are used. In the English-speaking world, the following distinction between fresh, cooked,
          and dry sausages seems to be more or less accepted:<br/></p>

        <ul class="exempt">
          <li class="exempt">Cooked sausages are made with fresh meats and then fully cooked. They are either eaten immediately after cooking
            or must be refrigerated. Examples include hot dogs, Braunschweiger, and liver sausage. Meat-and-grain sausages
            such as goetta, scrapple, and kishka are also cooked sausages.</li>
          <li class="exempt">Fresh sausages are made from meats that have not been previously cured. They must be refrigerated and thoroughly
            cooked before eating. Examples include Boerewors, Italian pork sausage, siskonmakkara, and breakfast sausage.</li>
          <li class="exempt">Dry sausages are cured sausages that are fermented and dried. Some are smoked as well at the beginning of the
            drying process. They are generally eaten cold and will keep for a long time. Examples include salami, Droë wors,
            Finnish meetvursti, Sucuk, Landjäger (smoked), Slim Jims, and summer sausage.</li>
          <li class="exempt">Dictionary Merriam-Webster, on the other hand, has stated that a <strong>hot dog is indeed a sandwich.</strong>
            United States Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg also weighed in on the matter, stating that a hot dog
            might be categorized to be a sandwich, but ultimately it comes down to the definition of a sandwich. She went on to
            acknowledge that a hot dog bun is a single roll that is not sliced all the way through and in that way is
            similar to a submarine sandwich.</li>
          <li class="exempt">Vegetarian sausage are made without meat, for example, based on soya protein or tofu, with herbs and spices.
            Some vegetarian sausages are not necessarily vegan and may contain ingredients such as eggs.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The distinct flavor of some sausages is due to fermentation by Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, or Micrococcus
          (added as starter cultures) or natural flora during curing.<br/></p>
